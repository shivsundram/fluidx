# fluidx
Jos Stam Stable fluids built for algorithmic and graphical flexibility 

Features:

particle and velocity advection

velcity diffusion

linear solver: gauss siedel preconditioned by L1 inverse

basic point click UI

periodic boundary conditions

Pressure gradient subtraction (incompressible flow)


Coming Soon:

pure Neumman boundary conditions

gauss siedel red black linear solver

chebychev linear solver
vorticity and buoyancy

Citation:
The UI/OpenGL functionality for this project is based off of the FluidsGL project from Nvidia. The rest of the code (algorithms, solvers etc) is my own work
